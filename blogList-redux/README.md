# BlogList Frontend 
This is the frontend of a fullstack application that let's you login (if you created a user) and save blogs that may interest you. 
It was build with Vite+React, and uses axios library for making the HTTP requests to the server.
This frontend is tested with Jest, using unit testing for some of the main components and Cypress for the EndToEnd testing.

## To make it work:
Fork the repo and install dependencies. After that run command `npm run dev`, then letter `o` to open in browser. Note that you wont be able to login to app or see anything without the setup of the server in the backend code. Instructions there --> [BACKEND REPO](https://github.com/pipiolus/blogList-backend)
